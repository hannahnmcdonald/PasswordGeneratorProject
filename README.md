This project is an intuitive application for password generator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The Javascript code in this project will prompt the user to choose their criteria for their password by length, upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If the inputed crtieria does not follow the parameters that are set, the user will recieve a prompt that will allow them to change their selections. Once criteria is selected, the user will recieve a unique and random password that meets the criteria they selected. 

This project implements the use of ASCII Character Codes like listed [here.](https://theasciicode.com.ar/)
